# Queue with Linked List Implementation

## API

FIFO = First In, First Out

head = pointer to the first item added to the queue
tail = pointer to the last item added to the queue

	1.	Create an empty queue

	2.	enqueue(value) => insert a new item at the tail of the queue

	3.	dequeue() => remove and return the item at the head of the queue

	4.	contains(value) => return T/F if queue contains value

	5.	isEmpty() => returns T/F if queue empty

	6.	size() => returns the number of items in the queue


## Running the App

	1. In the console, type the following command:

		$ node app.js
